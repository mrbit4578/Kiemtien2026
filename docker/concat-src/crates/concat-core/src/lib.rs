//! Core vocabulary of the Concat engine.
//!
//! This crate holds the types that every other crate needs to agree on, and
//! nothing else. It has no dependencies and does no IO.
//!
//! - [`time`] - exact rational timestamps. Every time value in Concat is a
//!   [`time::Rational`] number of seconds. Never `f64`.
//! - [`arena`] - generational arenas and `Copy` handles, the way Concat models
//!   graphs.
//! - [`frame`] - a decoded RGBA8 image buffer.
//! - [`timeline`] - projects, tracks and clips.
//!
//! If you are about to add a dependency to this crate, the thing you are adding
//! probably belongs in `concat-media` or `concat-render` instead.
