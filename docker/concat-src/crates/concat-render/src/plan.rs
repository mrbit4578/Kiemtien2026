//! Deciding what is on screen at a given instant, and describing it whole.
//!
//! A [`FramePlan`] is the contract between the editor model and whatever
//! draws pixels: the one description of a frame that both compositors
//! consume, and nothing else reaches them. It is built in two steps.
//!
//! [`plan_frame`] answers "what is on screen, from where, and how strongly":
//! for each visible layer, bottom-most first, the media, the exact source
//! timestamp, the placement, the opacity and the blend. It touches no
//! pixels and does no IO, so it is fast, exactly testable, and identical for
//! the CPU and GPU backends. The executor then fills in what the model has
//! no field for - the decoded picture, the crop, the flips, the effect chain
//! resolved for this frame, the mask, the transitions at the cut, the
//! treatments live over the stack - and hands the plan to a compositor.
//!
//! What a compositor does with one layer, in order: the crop, the flips and
//! the fit make the picture; the effects run over it; the mask, the fades
//! and the wipes weigh it; the placement puts it in the frame; the blend
//! meets what is beneath. The geometry and the weighing are worked out
//! here, once, so the two backends cannot drift on them.
