# The compiled-in cutout model

The downloaded models are listed in THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md at the
repository root and named in `src/models.rs`.

`selfie-segmentation.onnx` is Google's MediaPipe Selfie Segmentation model
(the general, 256 × 256 variant), converted to ONNX and published by the
ONNX Community at
<https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/mediapipe_selfie_segmentation>.
Both the model and the conversion are licensed under the Apache License,
Version 2.0; see THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md at the repository root.

The file is compiled into `concat-vision` with `include_bytes!`, so a
cutout needs no download and works the same on a desk and on a phone. The
model takes one RGB picture as `[1, 3, 256, 256]` floats in `0..=1` and
answers with `[1, 1, 256, 256]` probabilities that each pixel is a person.
