//! One-at-a-time job slots for long-running work.
//!
//! Export, transcription and model downloads are all "one at a time", and
//! a doc comment cannot enforce that: two exports would race each other's
//! temp files, and a cancel flag shared between runs would let a second
//! start clear it out from under the first. [`SingleFlight`] makes the
//! invariant code: `begin` refuses a second
//! concurrent job, and every run gets its own cancel flag, so a cancel can
//! only ever stop the job that is actually running and a new job can never be
//! un-cancelled by a stale start or stopped by a stale cancel.
