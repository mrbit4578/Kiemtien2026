//! The reader pool and frame cache: random access to any frame of any file.
//!
//! A decoder on its own reads *forward*: open it, pull frames in order,
//! drop it. That is exactly right for export and exactly wrong for
//! interactive use, where scrubbing asks for arbitrary (media, time) pairs.
//! This module is the answer:
//!
//! - **One reader per (file, level)**, kept warm between requests. A
//!   request near the reader's current position rolls forward (cheap,
//!   exact); a request elsewhere seeks - frame-accurately, guided by the
//!   real timestamps the linked decoder reports.
//! - **A byte-budgeted LRU of source frames** in front of the readers,
//!   keyed by the file, the level it was decoded at and the frame index -
//!   and nothing else. A source frame is the picture as the file holds
//!   it, turned the right way up, brought into BT.709 and scaled to a
//!   level: the file's own size halved as many times as still covers what
//!   was asked for. The crop and the effect chain are not in the key. They
//!   are applied to the cached picture on the way out, and their results
//!   kept in a second, smaller cache, so turning an effect knob costs a
//!   filter per frame and not a decode per frame, and scrubbing back over
//!   ground already covered costs a hash lookup whatever the knobs say.
//! - **Proxies.** A file can be given a stand-in - a smaller copy of
//!   itself - and a request that says so reads that instead, under its own
//!   key. Playback reads the proxy; the paused monitor reads the original.
//!
//! Frames roll into the cache as decoding passes them, so rolling forward
//! to frame N caches N-1 frames of the path there.
//!
//! Export decodes every frame exactly once in order and does not come
//! here, with one exception: a clip that runs backwards or on a speed
//! curve cannot be followed by a paced decoder, and each of its frames is
//! sought through [`ReaderPool::frame_at`], which bakes the chain into the
//! decoder the way the paced decoders beside it do. The two paths of one
//! export then agree to the pixel.
