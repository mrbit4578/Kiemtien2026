//! What FFmpeg's static archives need from a phone.
//!
//! On the desktop FFmpeg arrives as shared libraries that carry their own
//! dependencies. A phone links the archives that
//! `scripts/ffmpeg-mobile.sh` builds, and an archive brings nothing with
//! it: the platform libraries its code calls into - zlib, the hardware
//! codec bridges, and on Android the JNI shim - have to be named here.
//! The list is the `Libs:` line of the pkg-config files that build writes.
